# Straight line RPG #

This was a group project for my game programming(CSE 380). It was written in C++.
It used an engine given to us by our professor that I modified which handled all the threads and background running and uses Box2D for the physics.

### Set Up ###
* Clone the project and make sure you have visual studio on your machine as the game needs to be recompiled.
* After the project is recompiled, all you need to do is run the exe file it creates and the game will start up.
